Changes in 3.0.2: 
- corrected a mistake in the function JenningsInfoAllFields. This lead to theoretical mistakes in versions 3.0.0 and 3.0.1, as it was using an invariant only valid over Fp, namely the quotient by the second dimension subgroup (Passi-Sehgal 72)
- JenningBoundPairwise is now doing what it claimed to do before. The old function is now called JenningsBoundPairwiseWithIds
- slight modification of manual
- a mistake which could lead to break loops in SplitByGT, as functions were applied to empty bins, has been corrected
- included new invariant G/Agemo(G') for the case G' is cyclic and G is 2-generated (Margolis-Sakurai 25) in CyclicDerivedInfo and CyclicDerivedInfoAllFields
- Metacyclic groups included in IsCoveredByTheoryAllFields (due to Margolis-Sakurai 25, Theorem 3.6)
- if the first layers of the group algebras are not isomorphic the return of MIPSplitGroupsByAlgebras is now 1 rather than 0, for more consistency
- included Theorem 3.1.2 of Roehl 90 in IsCoveredByTheory. For the dimensions of dimension subgroup quotients of free pro-p groups Minac-Rogelstad-Tan 2016, Proposition 3.4 is used
- output of NormalSubgroupsInfo has changed (though mathematically it remains the same) to allow to understand which entry corresponds to which subgroup. Details included in manual 
- results from Brenner-Garcia-Lucas 24 included in IsCoveredByTheory (Theorem A) and SandlingInfo (Theorem B)
- some functions computing invariants which were returning errors for groups they were not thought for (like abelian groups) are fixed for these cases

------------------------------------------
Changes in version 3.0.1: LAGUNA is now a requiered package. This solves the issue of warnings coming up when ModIsom was loaded without LAGUNA

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Overview of files changed in Version 3.0.0 in respect to ModIsom 2.5.3:

ModIsomExt refers to a GAP package written by Leo Margolis and Tobias Moede the functionality of which is now included in this package, cf. https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=114036&token=7391a74bb71a93524f0dc24d07e5330c3d3cdf6e and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaca.2022.100001.

Changed:
- detbins.gi: 
-- New invariants and new functions for all fields. Also new functions which do not need the order as input. 
-- Some of the existing functions now give more information, e.g. ConjugacyClassInfo or SandlingInfo
-- Many of the functions are now documented. This concerns both, new and unchanged functions

- checkbin.gi:  
-- Corrected mistake in main function as done in ModIsomExt. Basically, just copied the file from ModIsomExt
-- New functionality which allows application to bigger fields
-- Print info on time etc. as in ModIsomExt 

- fprint.gi: corrected mistake in function PowerBasisWeights as done in ModIsomExt

New files:
- collect.gi as given in ModIsomExt. Function to efficiently compute with Jennings bases in Loewy series quotients of the augmentation ideal
- Jennings bound functions which in ModIsomExt are in detbins.gi into new files jenningsBound.g and jenningsConjecture.g
- kernelsize.gi: to compute kernel sizes of power maps
- tabletoalgebrandback.gi: functions which allow to convert hence and forth between elements in the group algebra (or rather the augmentation ideal) and the corresponding table
- detbinsRT.gi: for the ring-theoretic functions of detbins.gi in ModIsom

Technical differences between ModIsom and ModIsomExt:
- ModIsom uses BindGlobal while ModIsomExt uses InstallMethod. --> Has been changed everywhere to BindGlobal
- Documentation is generated differently. ModIsom uses GAPMacro --> Fused 

-------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------

- MIPBinsByGTAllFieldsInternal and MIPBinsByGTAllFields new functions for all fields
- MIPSplitGroupsByGroupTheoreticalInvariants and MIPSplitGroupsByGroupTheoreticalInvariantsNoCohomology and MIPSplitGroupsByGroupTheoreticalInvariantsAllFields and MIPSplitGroupsByGroupTheoreticalInvariantsAllFieldsNoCohomology new user friendly functions which only need list of groups as input


checkbin.gi:
- MIPBinSplit from ModIsomExt with change to allow to increase field
- MIPSplitGroupsByAlgebras new user friendly function with input list of groups (and optional number to increase field)

fprint.gi: correction of mistake in PowerBasisWeights as already done in ModIsomExt

collect.gi: like in ModIsomExt + new user friendly function ModIsomTable

detbinsRT.gi: functions in the second half of the old checkbin.gi
